# Daily Moments
A multi-platform application for uploading and storing photos to capture specific moments in a person's life.

# Description
Daily Moments is a platform designed for individuals to capture, organize, and protect personal experiences by uploading photos with dates and descriptions that are securely linked to their personal accounts in the Firebase database. Through an account, users can gain a personalized space where memories can be stored chronologically, building a digital timeline of their lives. As a result, each uploaded moment ensures that each memory is visually and contextually preserved. Daily moments eliminate the reliance on scattered photos by centralizing pictures in an organized, private, and accessible approach for those who want to look back on milestones, track personal growth, or share curated memories with loved ones.
